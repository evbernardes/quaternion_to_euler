# Quaternion to Euler Scipy Implementation
It contains the implementation of the method described in https://doi. for the direct conversion of a rotation Quaternion into Euler angles of any given sequence.
This implementation is heavily based in the Scipy implementation, in order to easily the differences in time execution of this method compared to the Quaternion-to-Matrix-to-Euler method implemented in Scipy.

## Contents:
- **euler_from_quat.py**: Implementation of the method in Scipy-based code style.
- **main.py**: Execution time comparison of both methods.
